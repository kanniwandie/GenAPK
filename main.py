    """ GenAPK is a groundbreaking platform that turns your ideas into fully functional mobile apps in less than a minute. Unlike website generators, which are common, mobile app generators are rare—and GenAPK stands out by not only generating clean, production-ready code but also building the app, hosting it, and letting you test it instantly—no manual coding, building, or downloading required. Share a link with friends to try your app on iOS or Android, and if you love it, publish the APK directly.

**With GenAPK you can:**

🔹 App Generation:  Turn simple prompts into fully functional apps—complete with clean Java/XML files and Material Design best practices.
